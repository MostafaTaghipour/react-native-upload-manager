# react-native-upload-manager

The only React Native http post file uploader with android and iOS background support.  If you are uploading large files like videos, use this so your users can background your app during a long upload.

NOTE: Use major version 4 with RN 47.0 and greater.  If you have RN less than 47, use 3.0.  To view all available versions:
`npm show react-native-background-upload versions`


# Installation

## 1. Install package

`npm install --save react-native-background-upload`

or

`yarn add react-native-background-upload`

Note: if you are installing on React Native < 0.47, use `react-native-background-upload@3.0.0` instead of `react-native-background-upload`

## 2. Link Native Code

### Autolinking (React Native >= 0.60)

##### iOS

`cd ./ios && pod install && cd ../`

##### Android

No further actions required.

### Automatic Native Library Linking (React Native < 0.60)

`react-native link react-native-background-upload`

### Or, Manually Link It

#### iOS

1. In the XCode's "Project navigator", right click on your project's Libraries folder ➜ `Add Files to <...>`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-background-upload` ➜ `ios` ➜ select `VydiaRNFileUploader.xcodeproj`
3. Add `VydiaRNFileUploader.a` to `Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries`

#### Android
1. Add the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

    ```gradle
    include ':react-native-background-upload'
    project(':react-native-background-upload').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../node_modules/react-native-background-upload/android')
    ```
2. Add the compile and resolutionStrategy line to the dependencies in `android/app/build.gradle`:

    ```gradle
    configurations.all { resolutionStrategy.force 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.4.1' } // required by react-native-background-upload until React Native supports okhttp >= okhttp 3.5

    dependencies {
        compile project(':react-native-background-upload')
    }
    ```


3. Add the import and link the package in `MainApplication.java`:

    ```java
    import com.vydia.RNUploader.UploaderReactPackage;  <-- add this import

    public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
        @Override
        protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
            return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
                new MainReactPackage(),
                new UploaderReactPackage() // <-- add this line
            );
        }
    }
    ```

4. Ensure Android SDK versions.  Open your app's `android/app/build.gradle` file.  Ensure `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` are 25.  Otherwise you'll get compilation errors.

## 3. Expo

To use this library with [Expo](https://expo.io) one must first detach (eject) the project and follow [step 2](#2-link-native-code) instructions. Additionally on iOS there is a must to add a Header Search Path to other dependencies which are managed using Pods. To do so one has to add `$(SRCROOT)/../../../ios/Pods/Headers/Public` to Header Search Path in `VydiaRNFileUploader` module using XCode.

# Usage

```js
import Upload from 'react-native-background-upload'

const options = {
  url: 'https://myservice.com/path/to/post',
  path: 'file://path/to/file/on/device',
  method: 'POST',
  type: 'raw',
  maxRetries: 2, // set retry count (Android only). Default 2
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/octet-stream', // Customize content-type
    'my-custom-header': 's3headervalueorwhateveryouneed'
  },
  // Below are options only supported on Android
  notification: {
    enabled: true
  },
  useUtf8Charset: true
}

Upload.startUpload(options).then((uploadId) => {
  console.log('Upload started')
  Upload.addListener('progress', uploadId, (data) => {
    console.log(`Progress: ${data.progress}%`)
  })
  Upload.addListener('error', uploadId, (data) => {
    console.log(`Error: ${data.error}%`)
  })
  Upload.addListener('cancelled', uploadId, (data) => {
    console.log(`Cancelled!`)
  })
  Upload.addListener('completed', uploadId, (data) => {
    // data includes responseCode: number and responseBody: Object
    console.log('Completed!')
  })
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log('Upload error!', err)
})
```

## Multipart Uploads

Just set the `type` option to `multipart` and set the `field` option.  Example:

```
const options = {
  url: 'https://myservice.com/path/to/post',
  path: 'file://path/to/file%20on%20device.png',
  method: 'POST',
  field: 'uploaded_media',
  type: 'multipart'
}
```

Note the `field` property is required for multipart uploads.

# API

## Top Level Functions

All top-level methods are available as named exports or methods on the default export.

### startUpload(options)

The primary method you will use, this starts the upload process.

Returns a promise with the string ID of the upload.  Will reject if there is a connection problem, the file doesn't exist, or there is some other problem.

`options` is an object with following values:

### getFileInfo(path)

Returns some useful information about the file in question.  Useful if you want to set a MIME type header.

`path` is a string, such as `file://path.to.the.file.png`

Returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

### cancelUpload(uploadId)

Cancels an upload.

`uploadId` is the result of the Promise returned from `startUpload`

Returns a Promise that resolves to an boolean indicating whether the upload was cancelled.

### addListener(eventType, uploadId, listener)

Adds an event listener, possibly confined to a single upload.

`eventType` Event to listen for. Values: 'progress' | 'error' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'

`uploadId` The upload ID from `startUpload` to filter events for.  If null, this will include all uploads.

`listener` Function to call when the event occurs.

# Customizing Android Build Properties
You may want to customize the `compileSdk, buildToolsVersion, and targetSdkVersion` versions used by this package.  For that, add this to `android/build.gradle`:

```
ext {
    targetSdkVersion = 23
    compileSdkVersion = 23
    buildToolsVersion = '23.0.2'
}
```

Add it above `allProjects` and you're good.  Your `android/build.gradle` might then resemble:
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

ext {
    targetSdkVersion = 27
    compileSdkVersion = 27
    buildToolsVersion = '23.0.2'
}

allprojects {

```

# FAQs

Is there an example/sandbox app to test out this package?

> Yes, there is a simple react native app that comes with an [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server where you can see react-native-background-upload in action and try things out in an isolated local environment.

[RNBackgroundExample](https://github.com/Vydia/react-native-background-upload/blob/master/example/RNBackgroundExample)

Does it support iOS camera roll assets?

> Yes, as of version 4.3.0.

Does it support multiple file uploads?

> Yes and No.  It supports multiple concurrent uploads, but only a single upload per request.  That should be fine for 90%+ of cases.

Why should I use this file uploader instead of others that I've Googled like [react-native-uploader](https://github.com/aroth/react-native-uploader)?

> This package has two killer features not found anywhere else (as of 12/16/2016).  First, it works on both iOS and Android.  Others are iOS only.  Second, it supports background uploading.  This means that users can background your app and the upload will continue.  This does not happen with other uploaders.

# Common Issues

## BREAKING CHANGE IN 3.0
This is for 3.0 only.  This does NOT apply to 4.0, as recent React Native versions have upgraded the `okhttp` dependencies.  Anyway...

In 3.0, you need to add
```gradle
    configurations.all { resolutionStrategy.force 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.4.1' }
```
to your app's app's `android/app/build.gradle` file.

Just add it above (not within) `dependencies` and you'll be fine.


## BREAKING CHANGE IN 2.0
Two big things happened in version 2.0.  First, thehe Android package name had to be changed, as it conflicted with our own internal app.  My bad.  Second, we updated the android upload service dependency to the latest, but that requires the app have a compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion or 25.

To upgrade:
In `MainApplication.java`:

Change

    ```java
    import com.vydia.UploaderReactPackage;
    ```

to

    ```java
    import com.vydia.RNUploader.UploaderReactPackage;
    ```

Then open your app's `android/app/build.gradle` file.
Ensure `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` are 25.

Done!


## Gratitude

Thanks to:
- [android-upload-service](https://github.com/gotev/android-upload-service)  It made Android dead simple to support.

- [MIME type from path on iOS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2439020/wheres-the-iphone-mime-type-database)  Thanks for the answer!
